                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    As a Product Manager at Hertz, I spearheaded the development and launch of a white-label 
                    shop and book platform for the Thrifty brand. This innovative platform was designed to 
                    streamline and unify the online booking process across all Hertz brands, replacing the 
                    need for multiple websites and regional variations. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The problem was customers were not progressing through the booking flow and were
                    instead dropping off at various stages. This was due to a number of factors including poor UX, 
                    and a lack of consistency across brands and regions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Post-launch, the platform demonstrated its value by increasing controlled conversion by 30%, 
                  contributing to an estimated annualised revenue of $30 million for all brands.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    As a Product Manager at Hertz, I launched a white-label 
                    modify and cancel platform for the Thrifty brand. This was designed to allow customers to modify
                    or cancel their bookings made on the white-label platform.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    The problem was customers were not able to modify or cancel their bookings on the existing platform
                    and as such were contacting customer support directly to modify and cancel their bookings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Post-launch, the platform demonstrated its value by reducing customer support calls related to modification
                  for Thrifty by 15%.

                    both in the bookning flow on the vehicle selection screen and on the my rentals section.

                  <p class="mb-4">
                    Hertz are moving towards and electric vehicle based fleet. The problem we had identified was
                    customers were not booking electric vehicles as much and it was determined that this was due 
                    to range anxiety and EVs being a newer technology that customers were unfamiliar with.
